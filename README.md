# Bayesian Machine Learning project: Stochastic Langevin Dynamics

This repository contains the code for the implementations of the principles of Bayesian Learning via Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD), Max Welling and Yee Whye Teh (2011). 

It contains 3 jupyter notebooks to describe our experiments on 3 topics involving SGLD:
  - A Bayesian logistic regression with Laplace prior: experiments on 3 data sets, comparison with other bayesian methods (Symmetric Adaptative Random Walks and Hamiltonian MCMC coded by ourselves).
  - A shallow bayesian neural network for the same classification task
  - A linear regression model with a comparison of SGLD with SAGA-LD (a version to reduce variance, depicted in Variance Reduction in Stochastic GradientLangevin Dynamics: https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2016/file/9b698eb3105bd82528f23d0c92dedfc0-Paper.pdf).
